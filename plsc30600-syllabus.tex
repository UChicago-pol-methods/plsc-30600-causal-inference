\section*{Course Overview}

Questions of cause and effect are central to the study of political science and to the social sciences more broadly. But making inferences about causation from empirical data is a significant challenge. Critically, there is no simple, assumption-free process for learning about a causal relationship from the data alone. Causal inference requires researchers to make assumptions about the underlying data generating process in order to identify and estimate causal effects. The goal of this course is to provide students with a structured statistical framework for articulating the assumptions behind causal research designs and estimating effects using quantitative data. 

The course begins by introducing the counterfactual framework of causal inference as a way of defining causal quantities of interest such as the ``average treatment effect." It then proceeds to illustrate a variety of different designs for identifying and estimating these quantities. We will start with the most basic experimental designs and progress to more complex experimental and observational methods. For each approach, we will discuss the necessary assumptions that a researcher needs to make about the process that generated the data, how to assess whether these assumptions are reasonable, how to interpret the quantity being estimated and ultimately how to conduct the analysis. 

This course will involve a combination of lectures, sections and problem sets. Lectures will focus on introducing the core theoretical concepts being taught in this course. Sections will emphasize application and demonstrate how to implement various causal inference techniques with real data sets. Problem sets will contain a mixture of both theoretical and applied questions and serve to reinforce key concepts and allow students to assess their progress and understanding throughout the course.

Assignments will involve analysis of data using the R programming language. This is a free and open source language for statistical computing that is used extensively for data analysis in many fields. Prior experience with the fundamentals of R programming is required.

\section*{Prerequisites}

This course is the third in the political science graduate methodology sequence. Completing the two courses prior to this sequence should prepare you for the material in this class. We will rely on some background knowledge of core concepts in probability, statistics and inference as well as experience with statistical programming in R. However, there are no strict, specific course pre-requisites as many different disciplines and departments offer introductory statistics classes that cover the relevant material. In general, you should have had some introduction to probability theory and should be familiar with concepts like the properties of random variables (especially expectation and variance), estimands and estimators, and statistical inference. Familiarity with regression modeling is a plus but not stricty required. Please contact the instructor at (\href{mailto:astrezhnev@uchicago.edu}{astrezhnev@uchicago.edu}) if you are interested in enrolling but are unsure of the requirements. 

\section*{Logistics}

\textbf{Lectures}: Mondays/Wednesdays from 3pm-4:20pm -- Location: Pick Hall, Room 506
\newline\textbf{Sections}: Friday from 9:30am - 10:20am -- Location: Pick Hall, Room 506
\newline\newline
You should attend sections regularly as they comprise a significant element of the course instruction.
\newline\newline \textbf{Disucssion Forum:} We will use a private \textsc{StackOverflow} forum as a course discussion platform at \url{https://stackoverflow.com/c/plsc-30600-causal-inference/}. See the  Canvas page for more details on how to join.
\newline\newline\textbf{Course Materials}: Lecture materials, assignments and section code will be posted on the course GitHub page at \url{https://github.com/UChicago-pol-methods/plsc-30600-causal-inference/}.

Readings will be posted on the Canvas website. You can find them under the ``Modules" section organized by week.


\section*{Textbooks} 

The course will involve readings from a variety of different textbooks and published papers. The class will not require the purchase of a single, specific, text and all excerpts from textbooks are available online (either directly or through library resources). However, we do recommend considering obtaining some of these texts to use as a personal reference and they may be valuable to you in the future.

In general, I have found the following books useful. You do not need to purchase \textit{all} of them, but it is worth being aware of them as they provide very good overviews from a variety of disciplines -- from econometrics to statistics to epidemiology.

\begin{itemize}
\item Cunningham, Scott. \emph{Causal inference: The Mixtape}. Yale University Press, 2021.
\item Huntington-Klein, Nick. \emph{The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality}. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2021.
\item Angrist, Joshua D., and Jorn-Steffen Pischke. \emph{Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist’s Companion}. Princeton University Press. 2009.
\item Imbens, Guido W. and Donald B. Rubin. \emph{Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences}. Cambridge University Press.  2010.
\item Hern\'an, Miguel A. and  James M. Robins. \emph{Causal Inference: What If}.  Chapman \& Hall/CRC. 2020. (PDF available at: \url{https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/})
\item Morgan, Stephen L., and Christopher Winship. \emph{Counterfactuals and Causal Inference.} Cambridge University Press, 2015.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Requirements}


Students’ final grades are based on three components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Problem sets} (25\% of the course grade). Students will complete a total of three problem sets throughout the quarter. Problem sets will primarily cover topics from the lecture and section for that week and the previous week.

The goal of the problem sets is to encourage exploration of the material and to provide you with a clear and credible means of assessing your understanding and progress through the course. As such, problem sets are \textit{designed} to be challenging and we expect students to find some questions difficult. Because problem sets are mainly a tool for communication between the students and instructional staff, they will not be graded in the usual fashion.

A few days after the release of the problem set, we will be posting the solution key. You should work through the problems \textit{without} the solutions for as long as you can, but should use the solutions after having completed your write-up to check your work. In addition to submitting your assignment write-up, you will also submit responses to a brief open-ended survey outlining which questions or topics you found easy or difficult, where you needed to consult the solutions, and what problems remain unclear or confusing. We will use these surveys to inform which topics to spend more time reviewing and to update the course to focus more on areas that students might be struggling with. 

Problem sets will be graded on a (+/\checkmark/-) scale with a + awarded for complete and near-perfect work, a \checkmark awarded for generally good work with clear effort shown but with some errors, and a - awarded for significantly incomplete work with major conceptual errors and little effort shown. Since the solutions will be available to you, there is essentially no reason to not get a + if you put in the effort and complete the assignment and the survey. Although the solutions will be posted, we \textit{highly encourage} you to not simply copy and paste solutions and code from our files as this ultimately defeats the entire purpose of the problem sets and will hurt you in preparing for the exams.
 
\begin{itemize}
       \item \textit{Collaboration policy}: We strongly encourage collaboration between students on the problem sets and highly recommend that students discuss problems with each other either in person or via Stack Overflow. However, each student is expected to submit their own write-up of the answers and any relevant code. 
        \item \textit{Office hours and online discussion}: Students should feel free to discuss any questions about the problem sets with the teaching staff during sections and office hours. We also strongly encourage students to post questions about both the problem sets and the assigned readings on the course Stack Overflow board and respond to other students’ questions. Responding to other students’ questions will contribute to your participation grade.
        \item \textit{Submission guidelines}: Problem sets will be distributed as \texttt{PDF} and \texttt{Rmarkdown} files (\texttt{.Rmd}). You should submit your answers and any relevant R code in the same format: including an \texttt{Rmarkdown} file (\texttt{.Rmd} extension) and a corresponding rendered \texttt{.pdf} file as your submission. \texttt{Rmarkdown} combines the text formatting syntax of Markdown markup language with the ability to embed and execute chunks of \texttt{R} code directly into a text document. This allows you to present your code, graphical output, and discussion/write-up all in the same document. We highly recommend that you edit the distributed \texttt{Rmarkdown} assignment file for each problem set directly to make organization easier.
        \end{itemize}
\item  \textbf{Take-home midterm and final exams} (30\% and 35\% of the course grade respectively). The take-home midterm and final will have the same format and structure as the problem sets but with two key differences. First, solutions will \textit{not} be posted -- the goal of the exams is to evaluate your understanding of the material and you will be graded on the accuracy of your responses to the problems. Second, you are \textbf{not} permitted to collaborate with other students or any other individual on the exams. The teaching staff will answer any clarifying questions on the \textsc{Stack Overflow} discussion board, but will not answer substantive questions.
    \item \textbf{Participation} (10\% of the course grade). We expect students to take an active role in learning in both lecture and section. Engagement with the teaching staff by asking and answering questions will contribute to this grade as will interaction on the \textsc{Stack Overflow} board.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Computing}

This course will use the \texttt{R} programming language. This is a free and open source programming language that is available for nearly all computing platforms. You should download and install it from \url{http://www.r-project.org}. Unless you have strong preferences for a specific coding environment, we also highly recommend that you use the free \href{https://rstudio.com}{RStudio} Desktop Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which you can download from \url{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download}. In addition to being a great and simple to use environment for editing code, \texttt{RStudio} makes it very easy to write and compile \texttt{Rmarkdown} documents: the format in which problem sets will be distributed. In addition to base \texttt{R}, we will be frequently using data management and processing tools found in the \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{tidyverse} set of packages along with basic graphics and visualization using \href{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/}{ggplot2}. 


\section*{Schedule}

A schedule of topics and readings is provided below. Each week will cover a single topic or group of topics. Monday lectures will typically be an introduction to the topic while Wednesday lectures will go into greater detail and involve some applications of the method.
