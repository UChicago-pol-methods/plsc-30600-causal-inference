# Last two weeks

- Techniques for addressing **unobserved confounding**
--

- Instrumental variables
  - Find a randomized (natural) experiment that affects your treatment and doesn't affect the outcome any other way.
--

- Difference-in-differences
  - Find an outcome where we know treatment has no effect (e.g. *before* treatment starts)
  - Use the observed difference on that outcome to de-bias the comparison between treated and control.
      
---

# This week

- Another strategy for identification when there exists **unobserved confounding**
--

- **Regression Discontinuity Designs**: What if the treatment is assigned via a "cut-off" rule?
  - All units below the cut-off remain under control
  - All units above the cut-off get treated
--

- If there's an observed *discontinuity* in the outcome, that might be evidence of a causal effect if...
  - The conditional expectations of the potential outcomes are truly continuous at the cut-off
--

- Often described as "as-good-as-random" assignment near the cut-off.

# Regression Discontinuity Designs

- Three components:
  - "Score"/"running"/"forcing" variable: $X_i$
  - Cut-off: $c$
  - Treatment is determined by $X_i$ and $c$
--

- $X_i$ is predictive of the potential outcomes - it's a confounder.
  - But all we'll need for identification is the *smoothness* of the CEFs of the potential outcomes around $c$
--

- Presence of an unexpected "jump" around $c$ is attributed to the causal effect of treatment.
--

- Examples from education:
  - Test score thresholds for allocating scholarships (Thistlewaite and Campbell, 1960)
  - Class size thresholds for splitting classes (Angrist and Lavy, 1999)
  - GPA thresholds for majors (Bleemer and Mehta, 2022)
--

- Examples from political science
  - Close elections! (Lee, 2008; Broockman, 2009; Gerber and Hopkins, 2011)

---

# Regression Discontinuity Designs

- Setup:
  - Treatment: $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$
  - Potential outcomes: $Y_i(1), Y_i(0)$
  - Observed outcomes (Consistency): $Y_i = Y_i(1)D_i + Y_i(0)(1- D_i)$
  - Score/running variable $X_i$
  - Threshold $c$

---

# Regression Discontinuity Designs

- **Sharp RD**: Treatment assignment is a deterministic function of the running variable $X_i$ and the cut-off $c$

$$D_i = \mathbb{1}(X_i \ge c) \text{  for all  } i$$
--

- Close (2 party) FPTP elections:
  - Candidates receiving above 50 percent (2-party) of the vote get elected
  - Candidates below 50 percent of the (2-party) vote do not.
--

- Sharp RD: Treatment is *deterministic*
  - Propensity score is a step function:
  
  $$P(D_i | X_i \ge c) = 1$$
  $$P(D_i | X_i < c) = 0$$

---

# Regression Discontinuity Designs

- **Assumption**: Continuity of the CEFs (around $c$):
  - We assume that $E[Y_i(0) | X_i = x]$ and $E[Y_i(1) | X_i = x]$ are continuous in $x$

--
- **Implications**:

  - The CEF of $Y_i(0)$ at $X_i = c$ is equal to the limit of the CEF from the bottom
  
  $$E[Y_i(0) | X_i = c] = \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i(0) | X_i = x]$$

--

  - All units below the discontinuity take control. 

  $$E[Y_i(0) | X_i = c] = \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i(0) | D_i = 0, X_i = x]$$
--

  - Then, by consistency

  $$E[Y_i(0) | X_i = c] = \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i | X_i = x]$$
  
---

# Regression Discontinuity Designs

- The same holds for the CEF of $Y_i(1)$ but taking the limit from the top

$$E[Y_i(1) | X_i = c] = \lim_{x \to c^{+}} E[Y_i | X_i = x]$$

--

- We can therefore identify the treatment effect **at the threshold** using the difference in the one-sided limits

$$\begin{align*}\tau_{\text{SRD}} &= E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X_i = c]\\
&= E[Y_i(1) | X_i = c] - E[Y_i(0) | X_i = c]\\
&= \lim_{x \to c^{+}} E[Y_i | X_i = x] - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i | X_i = x]
\end{align*}$$
--

- **Intuition** - We use the data below and above the cut-off to *extrapolate* to the cut-off. The difference in extrapolations is our estimate of the ATE.
  - All we need is **continuity** in the CEFs

---

# Extrapolation

- How does RD compare to other identification strategies?
- Implicitly we have a selection-on-observables assumption: $D_i$ is perfectly determined by $X_i$ 
  - Conditional on $X_i$ it's independent of the potential outcomes
--

- But unlike selection-on-observables, we have **no overlap/positivity**
  - $P(D_i = 1 | X_i < c) = 0$
--

- RD relies on *extrapolation* from the observed treated/control observations to a common value of $X_i$ - the cut-off or threshold $c$.
  - Extrapolation can be very sensitive to model specification - works best when there are many observations near $c$

---

# Interpreting the RD Estimand

- Like IV, RD identifies a *local* average treatment effect
--

- What if we're not interested in the effect at the discontinuity but the effect for the sample as a whole?
  - **External validity** challenge - how much effect heterogeneity is there?
  
.center[<img src="assets/cattaneo_example_2.png" alt = "cattaneo_2", height="400px">]

---

# Violations of continuity

- What could cause the potential outcomes to be discontinuous around $c$?
--

- **Bunching/Sorting**
  - Suppose individuals knew the cut-off and could manipulate their $X_i$ to get (or avoid) treatment
  - Another selection-into-treatment problem.
  - Can diagnose by looking at the histogram of observations around the discontinuity.
--

- **Other "treatments"**
  - Sometimes other factors will be "assigned" by a discontinuity along with the treatment
  - Common with geographical RDs - a lot of things change across a border!

---

# Example of "bunching"

# Estimation: Local Regression

---

# Estimation challenges

- With infinite data, we can get arbitrarily close to the true ATE at the discontinuity
  - More and more observations very close to $c$
--

- But with actual datasets, we might have very few observations *near* $c$.
  - Need to use observations that are further away and fit a *model* to extrapolate to the discontinuity.
--

- Bias-variance trade-off:
  - Using observations that are very far from the discontinuity might increase bias (especially if our assumptions on the CEF are wrong) but reduce variance.
  - Restricting us to only "close" observations might reduce bias but increase the variance.

---

# Binned scatterplots

- In a regression-discontinuity design, always plot your data!
  - Raw scatterplots are hard to interpret -- we want to start by trying to approximate the CEF without imposing any additional modeling assumptions
--

- **Binned scatterplots** - Plot the average of $Y_i$ within bins of $X_i$
  - Choice of binning method (equally spaced vs. quantile) and number of bins is a bias-variance trade-off
--

- Do we see the conditional expectation changing smoothly before and after the cut-point? Is there a visible gap at the cutpoint?

---

# Illustration: Incumbency Advantage

- Our running example will be the Lee (2008) "close elections" dataset.
- What is the size of the incumbency advantage in the U.S. House?
  - When Democrats barely win in time $t$ does it have an effect on their vote share in $t+1$?
--

- Variables
  - $X_i$ - Democratic margin of victory in time $t$
  - $Y_i$ - Democratic vote share in time $t+1$
  - $D_i$ - Victory in time $t$ (margin > $0$)

# Local polynomial regression

- **Goal**: Estimate $\lim_{x \to c^{+}} E[Y_i | X_i]$ and $\lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i | X_i]$
--

- Fit a *model* on the treated and control sides (respectively) and get the prediction at the cut-point.
- What *model*? A *local* polynomial regression
  - To reduce the approximation error from our choice of polynomial use only units with $X_i$ close to $c$ (within some bandwidth $h$)
  - Use the model to capture changes in $E[Y_i(d) | X_i = x]$ even near $c$
  
---

# Local polynomial regression

1. Choose a polynomial order $p$ and a kernel function $K(\cdot)$
  - Kernel captures how we should weight observations near the discontinuity vs. far
  - Lots of options: "triangular" is common (diminishing weight further from the discontinuity) but we'll just use a uniform kernel for this example.
--

2. Choose a bandwidth $h$
  - Observations outside of the bandwidth receive a weight of $0$. Observations inside the bandwidth get weight $K\left(\frac{X_i - c}{h}\right)$
  - With a uniform kernel, all observations get the same weight if they're inside the bandwidth
--

3. Fit a regression among observations $X_i \ge c$ of $Y_i$ on the polynomial of $(X_i - c), (X_i - c)^2, \dotsc, (X_i - c)^p$, weighting each observation by its kernel weight.

  $$\hat{E}[Y_i | X_i \ge x] = \hat{\mu}_{+} + \hat{\mu}_{+,1}(X_i - c) + \dotsc + \hat{\mu}_{+,p}(X_i - c)^p$$
--

4. Fit a regression among observations $X_i < c$ of $Y_i$ on the polynomial of $(X_i - c), (X_i - c)^2, \dotsc, (X_i - c)^p$,  weighting each observation by its kernel weight.

  $$\hat{E}[Y_i | X_i < x] = \hat{\mu}_{-} + \hat{\mu}_{-,1}(X_i - c) + \dotsc + \hat{\mu}_{-,p}(X_i - c)^p$$
--

5. Our RD estimate is the difference in intercepts from this regression: $\hat{\tau}_{\text{SRD}} = \hat{\mu}_+ - \hat{\mu}_-$

---

# Local polynomial regression

- We can do this all in a single regression with all polynomial terms interacted with the treatment variable
- Let's do a local *linear* fit with a bandwidth of $.1$ and a uniform kernel

```{r}
lm_robust(y ~ d + d*I(x-0), data=house %>% filter(abs(x) < .1))
```
- The coefficient on $d$ is the estimated gap at the discontinuity.

- Bandwidth of $0.05$:

# Bandwidth selection

- General criteria for how to choose $h$
  - Large $h$: More bias, lower variance
  - Small $h$: Less bias, higher variance
--

- If the true CEF is linear, we can get away with choosing a larger $h$ (since the model will be correct)
  - If the true CEF is non-linear, then our linear approximation will only be "good" for a small window.
  - How bad depends on the degree of non-linearity
--

- An "optimal" bandwidth minimizes the Mean Square Error $(\text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance})$
--

- Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) and Calonico et. al. (2014) - derive an approximation to the MSE to find an optimal solution. 
  - Depends on three main factors: density of observations around $c$, variance of $Y$ around $c$ and the curvature of the CEF around $c$.
- Confidence intervals using will still under-cover (the optimal MSE estimator is biased). 
  - Solution: Use a smaller $h$ than optimal or use a bias-correction (Cattaneo et. al., 2014)

# Discussion: Higher-order polynomials

- Chen, Ebenstein and Greenstone (2013: PNAS) attempt to estimate the effect of air polution on life expectancy using data from China.
- **Design** - Geographic RD using the Huai River - From 1950 to 1980 the Chinese government subsidized the use of coal for heating in cities North of the Huai river
  - The authors argue that this created an exogenous shock in air polution at the boundary.
  - Use a regression-discontinuity approach to estimate the effect of exposure to air polution on life expectancy.

# "Fuzzy" RD

---

# Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity

- Under a "fuzzy" RD, the probability of receiving treatment is no longer a jump from 0 to 1 at the cut-point.
- However, we will still assume that there is a jump in the probability of receiving treatment at the discontinuity
--

- **Assumption** - Discontinuity in the propensity score at $c$
  
$$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} Pr(D_i = 1 | X_i = x) \neq \lim_{x \to c^{-}} Pr(D_i = 1 | X_i = x)$$

--

- Often plausible in settings where the cutpoint acts as an *encouragement* to take treatment
  - e.g. Only individuals w/ incomes below $c$ are eligible to apply for a program but they are not *forced* into it.

---

# Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity

.center[<img src="assets/fuzzy_rd_pscore.png" alt = "fuzzy_rd", height="500px">]

---

# Fuzzy RD is IV

- Being above the cut-off is an *instrument*
  - $D_i(1)$: The treatment taken by unit $i$ when $X_i \ge c$
  - $D_i(0)$: The treatment taken by unit $i$ when $X_i < c$
--

- Under our original continuity assumption, applying the Sharp RD estimator to a Fuzzy RD setting recovers the **intent to treat effect**

$$\lim_{x \to c^{+}} E[Y_i | X_i = x] - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i | X_i = x]  = E[(D_i(1) - D_i(0))(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)) | X_i = c] = \tau_{\text{ITT}}$$

--

- ITT is driven by two elements
  - $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$: The actual treatment effect
  - $D_i(1) - D_i(0)$ The effect of being above the discontinuity on taking treatment.
  
---

# Fuzzy RD is IV

- What do we need to recover a LATE?
  - Continuity in $E[Y_i(1) | X_i = x]$ and $E[Y_i(0) | X_i = x]$ around $c$ are akin to exogeneity + exclusion restriction for the instrument
  - "Local randomization" assumptions also give a similar intuition.
--

- Need one more assumption: monotonicity: $D_i(1) \ge D_i(0)$
  - A "no-defiers" assumption at the discontinuity.
  - No one who refuses the treatment when above the cut-off would take the treatment if they were below the cut-off. 
  - No one who takes the treatment when below the cut-off would take it if they were above the cut-off.
--

- Under continuity and monotonicity, we get a familiar ratio estimator

$$\frac{\lim_{x \to c^{+}} E[Y_i | X_i = x] - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[Y_i | X_i = x]}{\lim_{x \to c^{+}} E[D_i | X_i = x] - \lim_{x \to c^{-}} E[D_i | X_i = x]} = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)| X_i = c, D_i(1) > D_i(0)]$$
- The ratio of ITT and first stage RD estimates recovers the local average treatment effect at the cut-point among compliers.

---

# Estimation

- We can just take the ratio of the two regression coefficients from the reduced form and the first stage RDs
--

- To get CIs, we can do this with a 2SLS approach - for a (local) linear model.
- First stage

$$D_i = \delta_0 + \rho \mathbb{I}(X_i \ge c) + \delta_1(X_i - c) + \delta_2(X_i - c)\mathbb{I}(X_i \ge c) $$

- Second stage

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \tau D_i + \beta_1(X_i - c) + \beta_2(X_i - c)\mathbb{I}(X_i \ge c) $$
--

- All weak instrument problems still apply here! Need a strong first stage to do reliable inference.

---

# Example: Majoring in Economics

- Bleemer and Mehta (2022, AEJ:AE) look at the effects of majoring in economics as an undergraduate on early-career wages.
- **Design**: Fuzzy RD using a GPA cut-off
  - UC Santa Cruz's Economics department implemented a policy that only permitted students receiving below a 2.8 GPA in Econ 1 and 2 to major "at the discretion of the department"

---

- Not all students below threshold did not major, not all students above the threshold majored

# Diagnosing assumptions

---

# Placebo checks

- One consequence of the continuity assumption in RD is that we should also expect any pre-treatment covariates to be continuous around the cut-point as well.
- Common to conduct "placebo" RDs across the discontinuity on covariates known to be unaffected by treatment.
  - Presence of a non-zero discontinuity would suggest "sorting" with different types of respondents more likely to be below vs. above
- All the usual placebo test caveats apply

# Density tests

- One intuitive approach to testing for "bunching" at the cut-point is to see whether the number of observations just below vs. just above is roughly the same.
  - Consistent with the "locally randomized experiment" interpretation of the RDD (Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vasquez-Bare, 2017).
- Straightforward binomial hypothesis test: The number of observations above vs. below the cut-off in a certain window should be about 1/2.

# Density tests

- **Example**: Consider a window of $.01$ for our close elections RD
```{r}
house %>% filter(abs(x) <= .01) %>% group_by(d) %>% summarize(n())
```

---

# Density tests

- We have 56 elections above and 50 below. What's the probability that we would see this just by chance (under independent coin flips)

```{r}
binom.test(x=56, n = 106)
```

# Density tests

- McCrary (2008) argues that if units are not able to manipulate their $X_i$, then the density of $X_i$ around the discontinuity should be continuous.
  - The histogram shouldn't have any huge drop-off at $c$
--

- **Intuition**
  - Construct a histogram of the running variable (with bins selected to not overlap at the discontinuity)
  - Smooth the histogram by fitting a local linear regression of the histogram heights on the bin mid-points
  - Test for the difference in the smoothed histogram near the discontinuity
--

- More modern approach in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2020) using a local polynomial density estimator
  - Implemented in `rddensity`

# Density tests

```{r}
density_test  <- rddensity::rddensity(house$x, c=0, bino=F, massPoints=F)
summary(density_test)
```

# Overview

- Regression discontinuity designs leverage a known treatment assignment process based on a "score" $X_i$ and a cut-off $c$.
  - Key assumption is *continuity* in the CEFs $E[Y_i(1) | X_i]$ and $E[Y_i(0) | X_i]$ around $c$
--

- Be wary of sorting around the discontinuity
  - Placebo testing with pre-treatment covariates
  - Density tests
--

- Estimation challenges are significant in RD
  - Why? Because we're *extrapolating* to a discontinuity!
  - Results can be very sensitive to arbitrary modeling choices
--

- Modern approaches to RD use **local** regressions (w/ some bandwidth around the cut-off) with lower-order polynomials (linear or quadratic).
  - Beware cubic polynomials and above! Poor boundary properties.
  - Typically assess sensitivity across lots of different bandwidth choices
--

- Always plot your RDs!
