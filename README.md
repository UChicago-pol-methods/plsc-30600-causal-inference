# Welcome to Causal Inference

# Getting course materials
We use this repository to distribute course materials: slides, assignments, data, and lab materials.

To download a file: Locate the file in the repository. Then "right-click" on the "Raw" button and save to your computer.

However, we recommend setting up a Github account and cloning the repository on your local machine. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a relatively easy-to-use GUI interface to interacting with Git.

# Readings and assignment submissions
Readings will be posted on the course's Canvas site: https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/54699 - You should also submit your assignments and take-home exams here.
