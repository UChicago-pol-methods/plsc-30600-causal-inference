# Welcome to Causal Inference
This is the github repository for Causal Inference (PLSC30600) at the University of Chicago, taught by [Anton Strezhnev](https://www.antonstrezhnev.com). [Cindy Wang](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/directory/cindy-wang) is the teaching assistant for Winter 2025

# Getting course materials
We use this repository to distribute course materials: slides, assignments, data, and lab materials.

To download a file: Locate the file in the repository. Then "right-click" on the "Raw" button and save to your computer.

However, we recommend setting up a Github account and cloning the repository on your local machine. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a relatively easy-to-use GUI interface to interacting with Git.

# Readings and assignment submissions
Readings will be posted on the course's Canvas site. Assignments should be submitted on Canvas and via Gradescope.
